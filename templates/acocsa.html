      <h5 class="card-title">Ant Colony Optimization</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Ant colony optimization is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants. Ants are known for their ability to find the shortest path between their nest and a food source. They achieve this by leaving a trail of pheromones as they move towards the food source, which attracts other ants to follow the same path. This process of pheromone trail laying and following is the basis of ant colony optimization algorithms. Ant colony optimization algorithms have been extensively studied and applied to solve a variety of optimization problems. The algorithm has proven to be highly effective in finding optimal solutions to problems in various fields, including transportation, telecommunications, and engineering. This paper provides a comprehensive review of ant colony optimization algorithms, their components, and their applications.

      <h5 class="card-title">Crow Search Algorithm</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The working mechanism of CSA is based on the social behavior of crows, where the foraging behavior of crows is used to search for the optimal solution. CSA starts by initializing a population of crows, where each crow represents a potential solution to the optimization problem. The crows communicate with each other using a combination of local and global information. Local information is obtained by the individual crow's experience, while global information is obtained from the best solution obtained so far. Based on this information, the crows adjust their position in the search space to move towards the optimal solution. CSA uses three main operators, namely exploration, exploitation, and memorization. Exploration aims to search for new solutions by exploring the search space. Exploitation aims to exploit the best solution obtained so far by focusing on the promising areas in the search space. Memorization aims to remember the best solution obtained so far by storing it in the memory of each crow.
